            <p>In a blunt and urgent warning, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel 
            on Climate Change said many of the changes 
            already set in motion by the warming of the planet, 
            such as melting polar ice caps and the steady sea level rise,
            are irreversible over hundreds to thousands of years. Many other observed changes in the climate, 
            such as more numerous and longer droughts in some regions and increased frequency of intense rainfall 
            and even flooding in others, are without precedent in thousands if not hundreds of thousands of years. 
            That human activity was the principal cause in bringing about these changes is “undisputed.”
            
            <p>The IPCC said in the best case scenario, where such strong reductions take place, 
            benefits for air quality would come quickly, but it still could 
            take 20 to 30 years to see global temperatures stabilize.
